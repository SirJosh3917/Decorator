# Decorator.Server
This is the part of `Decorator` that will have the method invokation methods, deserializable handlers, and addition `BaseMessage` logic of the old `Decorator`.

Until the regular `Decorator` is done, this part of the `Decorator` ecosystem will be neglected. After this is complete, then work into `Decorator.Serialize` will be put in.
