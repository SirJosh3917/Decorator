# Decorator
This is the core Decorator project, which ONLY handles `Serialization` and `Deserialization` of `object[]` and nothing else.

If you're looking for the old features of Decorator that invoked methods and had message support, check out `Decorator.Server`. That's where that stuff will go.

Inspired by how https://github.com/LukeMiles49/Deserialiser handles deserialization, this is how the new Decorator is built.
